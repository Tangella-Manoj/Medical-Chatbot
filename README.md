# Medical-Chatbot

I developed a chatbot using Python and the decision tree algorithm to provide health advice based on user symptoms. The chatbot analyzes user inputs to suggest possible medical conditions, recommends actions, and advises when to consult a doctor.

Technologies Used: Python, scikit-learn, HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

Features:

Symptom-based decision-making for accurate recommendations.

Easy-to-use interface for users.
